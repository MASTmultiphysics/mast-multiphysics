\page Install Installation

MAST runs on various flavors of Unix and can leverage MPI for
distributed memory parallelism. The required list of dependencies includes
    - hdf5
    - boost
    - eigen3
    - cmake
    - MPI
    - PETSc
    - SLEPc
    - libMesh

These dependencies can be installed from an automated
package manager before proceeding with installation of MAST. It is
recommended that PETSc be installed with support for direct sparse
solvers, such as MUMPS, SuperLU_dist or Pardiso.

Given that a large number of dependencies are required for MAST, it is strongly
recommended that an automated package manager be used to install the dependencies
listed above.
    - On Mac OS [Macports](https://www.macports.org) and
    [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) have been used with good success to install all
    dependencies except libMesh since no recipe/port has been created for libMesh
    in these package managers (as of Feb 2019).
    - [Spack](https://spack.io) is a python-based package manager that can install
    MAST and all dependencies.
