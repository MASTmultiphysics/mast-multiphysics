     *  This object stores the information about the coupling of nodes.
     *  A slave node can be constrained to one or more nodes and the rotations
     *  of the slave can be constrained (set equal to) the rotation of
     *  the master node. In case more than one master nodes are specified, then
     *  the coefficients in the constraint equation are weighted based on
     *  inverse relationship with the geometric distance and partition-of-unity.
     *
     *  The constraints are defined such that the displacement of the slave nodes
     *  is identified as
     *  \f[  u_s = u_m + \theta \times (X_s - X_m),   \f]
     *  where, \f$ \theta \f$ is the rotation vector
     *  \f$(\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z)\f$,
     *  \f$ u_s \f$ and \f$ X_s \f$ are the translation and location
     *  of the slave nodes, respectively, and likewise for the master node
     *  with subscript \f$ (\cdot)_m \f$. Note, that the rotations of the
     *  slave node are not constrained to those of the master node. The
     *  cross product is written as
     *  \f{eqnarray*}{ \theta \times dX
     *  & = & \left| \begin{array}{ccc}
     *           \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
     *           \theta_x & \theta_y & \theta_z \\
     *           dx & dy & dz
     *        \end{array} \right| \\
     *  & = &    \hat{i} (\theta_y dz - \theta_z dy)
     *         - \hat{j} (\theta_x dz - \theta_z dx)
     *         + \hat{k} (\theta_x dy - \theta_y dx)
     *  \f}
     *   Therefore, the constraint for displacement along the x-axis is
     *  \f[ u_{xs} = u_{xm} + (\theta_y dz - \theta_z dy),  \f]
     *   for displacement along the y-axis,
     *  \f[ u_{ys} = u_{ym} + (\theta_x dz - \theta_z dx),  \f]
     *   and for displacement along the z-axis,
     *  \f[ u_{zs} = u_{zm} + (\theta_x dy - \theta_y dx).  \f]
